Code for the CS31620 FAA (Feline Adoption Agency) app, version 6. Ready to use.

This is a Kotlin project.

This is version developed by students in workshop 16.

This adds Architecture components: Entities, DAOs, Room and also uses a Repository. 
At this stage the data is not displayed in the UI. You will have to use 
the AS Device File Explorer or debug breakpoints to see the database 
creation in action. Version 7 will use ViewModels etc to display the data.
